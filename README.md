# Hackathon Name TBD
## Date: August 4th - 5th 2018

### Introduction
Thanks for considering being a part of coordinating this hackathon! I think this event can be extremely awesome with the help from people like you.
This online hackathon is a collaberation between many Creative/Programming streamers on Twitch to bring each community into one centeralized event. The duration of this hackathon is planned for 24 hours and is encouraged that you stream as much of it as you can!

### Why should you help coordinate?
* Help promote creative/programming streaming on Twitch
* The more streamers we have the more organic promotion you have on your channel
* Build something awesome that could really help your channel or engage your viewers even more

### Prizes
Being able to award participants prizes for their best hacks is a very rewarding and encouraging incentive to get people to come and participant in this hackathon. I am personally trying my best to get funding to get some awesome prizes for everyone. If you are interested in contributing anything towards prizes that would be extremely helpful. I do want to note that this is not required at all to help coordinate.

### Getting Started
If you are interested in helping out please head over to the [PixelogicDev Discord](discord.gg/QECjjX9) and let us know you are there. You will then receive a Hack Coordinator role where you will have access to the channel. I can then add you to this repo to begin editing as needed.
